Ces classifications sont sans doute baséee sur d'anciennes images, car NGC 3125 n'a rien d'une galaxie elliptique contenant surtout de vieilles étoiles. Les images prises par le télescope spatial Hubble montrent en effet que sa forme n'est pas définie et qu'elle ressemble même aux Nuages de Magellan tout en étant incompréhensiblement plus brillante que ces derniers. La classification de galaxie irrégulière particulière de type magellanique (Im? pec) par le professeur Seligman semble donc mieux convenir à ce que nous connaissons maintenant de cette galaxie.\\nToutefois, la base de données NASA/IPAC indique aussi que NGC 3125 est une galaxie naine bleue compacte (BCDG, Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxy), c'est-à-dire une galaxie naine contenant de grands amas stellaires composés d'étoiles jeunes, chaudes et massives donnant à l'ensemble une couleur dominante bleue. Dans la mesure où elles sont constituées d'amas, ces galaxies n'ont pas de forme définie, ce qui semble bien s'appliquer à cette galaxie.\\n\\nUne galaxie à sursaut de formation d'étoiles et une galaxie Wolf-Rayet\\n\\nS'étendant sur environ 16 000 années-lumière, NGC 3125 connait de violents sursauts de formation d'étoiles massives, comme en témoignent les jeunes étoiles bleues dispersées dans le noyau rosâtre de la galaxie. Certains de ces amas d'étoiles sont vraiment remarquable. L'un des amas les plus extrêmes d'étoiles Wolf-Rayet de notre région de l'Univers, NGC 3125-A1, se trouve dans NGC 3125 que l'on peut ainsi qualifier de galaxie de Wolf-Rayet.\\nUne récente étude a été réalisée dans les domaines de l'ultraviolet lointain et du proche infrarouge à l'aide du télescope spatial Hubble pour trois amas (A1, B1 et B2) présents dans cette galaxie. L'âge estimé de ces amas se situe entre 3 et 4 millions d'années et leur masse est respectivement de 1,7 x 10⁵ , 1,4 x 10⁵  et 1,1 x 10⁵ . La proportion d'étoiles Wolf-Rayet à celle d'étoiles de type O est de 0,23 et de 0,10, une proportion rarement vu dans d'autres galaxies.
